</b></font><dir><font size="4"><b>

</b></font><font size="3"><p align="JUSTIFY">The abstract should 
describe the basic message of the paper, including: the problem, why 
your solution should be of interest, some notion that your solution is 
effective, and a teaser about how it has been evaluated. Cover all of 
this using between 75 and 150 words. Thus, the abstract is the hardest 
part to write. Sometimes I try to write it first, but the final version 
is usually composed of items drawn from the introduction, and then 
condensed, as the last step of writing the paper.</p>

<b><font size="4"><p>1. Introduction</p>
</font><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><p>The problem we have solved</p>

</font></b><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><ul><b>

</b><ul><b>
</b><li>Concentrate on making <i>this</i> assertion and <i>only </i>this assertion in a succinct set of 1 to 3 paragraphs </li>
<li>A common mistake is to explain too much of the problem context 
first. Instead, state the problem essentially as a claim, and leave 
explanations supporting your claim to the next part, "Why it is not 
already solved."</li></ul>
</ul>

</font><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><p>Why the problem is not already solved or other solutions are ineffective in one or more important ways</p>

</font></b><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><ul><b>

</b><ul><b>
</b><li>Your new idea need not solve every problem but it should solve at least one that is not already solved</li>
<li>This is the place to provide a succinct description of the problem 
context giving enough information to support the claim that a problem 
exists, made in the preceding problem declaration.</li></ul>
</ul>

</font><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><p>Why our solution is worth considering and why is it effective in some way that others are not</p>

</font></b><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><ul><b>

</b><ul><b>
</b><li>A succinct statement of why the reader should care enough to read the rest of the paper.</li></ul>
</ul>


<ul>

<ul>
<li>This should include a statement about the characteristics of your 
solution to the problem which 1) make it a solution, and 2) make it 
superior to other solutions to the same problem.</li></ul>
</ul>

</font><p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><p>How the rest of the paper is structured</p>

</font></b><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><ul><b>

</b><ul><b>
</b><li>The short statement below is often all you need, but you should 
change it when your paper has a different structure, or when more 
information is <i>required</i> to describe what a given section contains. If it isn’t <i>required</i> then you don’t want to say it here.</li></ul>
</ul>

</font><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rest of this paper first discusses related work in Section 2, and
 then describes our implementation in Section 3. Section 4 describes how
 we evaluated our system and presents the results. Section 5 presents 
our conclusions and describes future work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><font size="4"><p>2. Related Work</p>
</font><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><p>Other efforts that exist to solve this problem and why are they less effective than our method</p>

</font></b><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><ul><b>

</b><ul><b>
</b><li>Resist the urge to point out only flaws in other work. Do your 
best to point out both the strengths and weaknesses to provide as well 
rounded a view of how your idea relates to other work as possible</li>
<li>In a social and political sense it is <i>very smart</i> as well as 
ethically superior to say good things, which are true, about other 
people’s work. A major motivation for this is that editors and program 
committee members have to get a set of reviews for your paper. The 
easiest way for them to decide who should review it is to look at the 
set of references to <i>related work</i> (e.g., [1,2, 3]) to find people
 who are likely to be competent to review your paper.  The people whose 
work you talk about are thus likely to be reading what you say about <i>their</i> work while deciding what to say about <i>your</i> work. </li>
<li>Clear enough? Speak the truth, say what you have to say, but be generous to the efforts of others.</li></ul>
</ul>

</font><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><p>Other efforts that exist to solve 
related problems that are relevant, how are they relevant, and why are 
they less effective than our solution for this problem</p>

</font></b><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><ul><b>

</b><ul><b>
</b><li>Many times no one has solved your exact problem before, but 
others have solved closely related problems or problems with aspects 
that are strongly analogous to aspects of your problem</li></ul>
</ul>

</font><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><font size="4"><p>3. Implementation</p>
</font><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><p>What we (will do | did): <i>Our Solution</i></p><i>
</i><p>&nbsp;</p>

</font></b><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><ul><b>

</b><ul><b>
</b><li>Another way to look at this section is as a paper, within a 
paper, describing your implementation. That viewpoint makes this the 
introduction to the subordinate paper, which should describe the overall
 structure of your implementation and how it is designed to address the 
problem effectively.</li>
<li>Then, describe the structure of the rest of this section, and what each subsection describes.</li></ul>
</ul>

</font><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><p>How our solution (will | does) work</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</font></b><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><ul><b>

</b><ul><b>
</b><li>This is the body of the subordinate paper describing your 
solution. It may be divided into several subsections as required by the 
nature of your implementation.</li>
<li>The level of detail about how the solution works is determined by 
what is appropriate to the type of paper (conference, journal, technical
 report)</li>
<li>This section can be fairly short for conference papers, fairly long for journal papers, or <i>quite</i> long in technical reports. It all depends on the purpose of the paper and the target audience</li>
<li>Proposals are necessarily a good deal more vague in this section 
since you have to convince someone you know enough to have a good chance
 of building a solution, but that you have not <i>already </i>done so.</li></ul>
</ul>

</font><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><font size="4"><p>4. Evaluation</p>
</font></b><p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><p>How we tested our solution</p>

</font></b><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><ul><b>

</b><ul><b>
</b><li>Performance metrics </li>
<li>Performance parameters</li>
<li>Experimental design</li></ul>
</ul>

</font><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><p>How our solution performed, how its 
performance compared to that of other solutions mentioned in related 
work, and how these results show that our solution is effective</p>

</font></b><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><ul><b>

</b><ul><b>
</b><li>Presentation and Interpretation</li>
<li>Why, how, and to what degree our solution is better</li>
<li>Why the reader should be impressed with our solution</li>
<li>Comments</li></ul>
</ul>

</font><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><p>Context and limitations of our solution as required for summation</p>

</font></b><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><ul><b>

</b><ul><b>
</b><li>What the results <i>do </i>and <i>do not</i> say</li></ul>
</ul>

</font><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><font size="4"><p>5. Conclusions and Future Work</p>
</font><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><p>The problem we have solved</p>

</font></b><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><ul><b>

</b><ul><b>
</b><li>The most succinct statement of the problem in the paper. Ideally
 one sentence. More realistically two or three. Remember that you simply
 state it without argument. If you have written a good paper you are 
simply reminding the reader of what they now believe and of how much 
they agree with you.</li></ul>
</ul>

</font><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><font size="6"></font><p><font size="6"> </font><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Our solution to the problem</font></p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">

</font></b><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><ul><b>

</b><ul><b>
</b><li>Again, the succinct statement that you have presented a solution</li>
<li>Sometimes it works well to leave it at that and not even describe 
your solution here. If you do, then again state your solution in one or 
two sentences taking the rhetorical stance that this is all obvious. If 
you have a good solution and have written an effective paper, then the 
reader already agrees with you.</li></ul>
</ul>

</font><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><p>Why our solution is worthwhile in some significant way</p>

</font></b><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><ul><b>

</b><ul><b>
</b><li>Again, a succinct restatement in just a few sentences of why 
your solution is worthwhile assuming the reader already agrees with you</li></ul>
</ul>

</font><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><p>Why the reader should be impressed and/or pleased to have read the paper</p>

</font></b><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><ul><b>

</b><ul><b>
</b><li>A few sentences about why your solution is valuable, and thus 
why the reader should be glad to have read the paper and why they should
 be glad you did this work.</li></ul>
</ul>

</font><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><p>What we will (or could) do next</p>

</font></b><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><ul><b>

</b><ul><b>
</b><li>Improve our solution</li>
<li>Apply our solution to harder or more realistic versions of this problem</li>
<li>Apply our solution or a related solution to a related problem</li></ul>
</ul>
