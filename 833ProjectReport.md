# The Development and Application of Hadoop and NoSQL 

## Aarti Parupudi, Quan Kong, Wenbo Wang

### 1. Abstract

### 2. Introduction

#### 2.1 Hadoop

* The reason we need Hadoop
* The functionality of Hadoop
* The implementation and history of Hadoop (Spark) 

#### 2.2 NOSQL

* **The Definition of NoSQL**: A NoSQL (often interpreted as Not Only SQL) database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.
* **Motivation of NoSQL**: 
	* Avoidance of Unneeded Complexity;
	* High Throughput;
	* Horizontal Scalability and Running on Commodity Hardware;
	* Avoidance of Expensive Object-Relational Mapping;
	* Complexity and Cost of Setting up Database Clusters;
	* Compromising Reliability for Better Performance;
	* The current "One size fit's it all" Databases Thinking Was and Is Wrong;
	* The Myth of Effortless Distribution and Partitioning of Centralized Data Models;
	* Movements in Programming and Languages and Development Frameworks;
	* Requirements of Cloud Computing;
	* The RDBMS plus Caching-Layer Pattern/Workaround vs. Systems Built from Scratch with Scalability in Mind;
	* Yesterday's vs. Today's Needs;

* **Types of NoSQL databases**: this basic classification is based on data model. 
	* Column
	* Document
	* Key-value
	* Graph
	* Multimodel Databases
